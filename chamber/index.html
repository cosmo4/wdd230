          This month Dave and Sue's Diner won in all our categories for Business
          of the Month. Julia, a long time employee, noted, "Working here has
          given me such a good opportunity to interact with the good people of
          Star. I can honestly say, working here doesn't feel like work." With
          the highest rating of google reviews, it's no wonder it was voted as
          Best Restaurant in Star in 2022. If you're looking for good food and
          happy people, Dave and Sue's Diner is the place. Look for them on Main
